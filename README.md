# BI & Analytics SQL Test

This repository contains the resolution of the **Business Case for BI & Analytics | Latam**, focused on solving business questions with SQL queries on a simulated large-scale dataset.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The goal of this project is to answer a series of business questions using **PostgreSQL**, based on two example tables:

- **Table A**: Content play records (streaming history).
- **Table B**: Subscription status records.

## ðŸ“Š Business Questions Addressed

1. How many unique accounts streamed in June 2021, how many total hours were streamed, and what was the average of hours streamed per account?  
2. How many accounts watched series in Argentina during the week of June 28th to July 4th?  
3. What other content was watched by users who streamed *Loki*?  
4. For paid accounts only: evaluate duplication, intersection, and exclusivity across the movies *Luca*, *Raya and the Last Dragon*, and *Soul*.  
5. For users who streamed *Avengers Infinity War*: how many days had passed since their last stream, and what was the last content streamed before *Infinity War*?
